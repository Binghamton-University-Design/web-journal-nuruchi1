  	            <h1><a href="">Project Proposal: </a></h1>

  	           		<h3 class= "indent"> For my project I want to create an informative digital story on the topic of nail polish. From my research I could not find a digital story or existing website/ video that contains several different subtopics of nail polish. Most of this information is scattered and there is some information that is difficult to find. This inspired me to continue with this topic as I wanted to create a digital story that is both informative and could seem like a master list of information for the topic. With this idea in mind, as of now I have planned four main topics to focus on: The history of nail polish, Trends, The science behind nail polish, and Media, males, and nail polish. Each of these topics, excluding the history section, will have at least one subcategory that the viewer can learn more information. </h3>

	<h3 class= "indent"> The initial home page would have an option to toggle music on and off and the possibility to skip songs if time permits. There will be a start button option as well as tags in the header for each section and sub section, that when clicked, will bring the user to the chosen section. If the user clicks on the pay button, then the website will change to the history tab at first, then transition from section to section. In providing this option here, the user has the choice on how they experience the digital story. The user can have passive interaction, by allowing the sections play automatically; or active interaction by picking which sections catch their eye and in what order they would like to see the information. The overall design of the digital story will have a color theme to keep a harmonious feeling throughout the different sections. </h3>

	<h3 class= "indent"> For the History section, I have plans to implement a side scroller so that the viewer will see the notable linear history. The time frame will range from ancient Egypt up to present time. Since I will be using a side scroller, there will be a large number of graphics for this section. For each notable moment in time there will be a small text box with the information and a small graphic to bring some color to this section. This is to present the information in a colorful attention-grabbing way, so that the viewer will not click away quickly. All information in this section will be gathered from the resources stated in the bibliography. </h3>


	<h3 class= "indent"> The next section that would be implemented is the trends section. This section will also have a decent number of graphics, potentially re-makes of original ads and or images used during the time of the trend. All information in this section would be taken from the resources stated in the below bibliography. As for how this section will be implemented, a small up and down scroller may be used with the years displayed. When the user hovers their mouse over the year, either an information box will appear below, or the year will be replaced with the information and accompanying graphic. Another design option would be to create two different inner pages, or sub sections.  The sub sections would be one for tends of the past (~2000 and earlier) and recent trends (~2000 to now). These pages will potentially have a similar design as the one already stated in this section. Since this design is not for certain, further research and a mockup is needed to see plausibility of this design.
	</h3>

	<h3 class= "indent">The third section is the science behind nail polish. This section will potentially have three sub sections: the chemical component of nail polish; 5-free vs 10-free and what is it; and animal testing and nail polish. These sub sections are not guaranteed since further research is needed to ensure that there is enough public information to collate and present without one sub section being noticeably smaller than the others. Design wise, each sub section will have a similar layout to keep a cohesive theme and may be presented in a similar fashion. After collection more information, a mockup will be created to determine the best design for this section. </h3>

	<h3 class= "indent">Lastly the final section: media, males, and nail polish, would be a large section in this digital story.  This section will require several different sources and the information displayed may overlap with the previously stated main sections. There would be four possible sub sections: media influence on nail polish; a brief history of men and their use of nail polish; gender and nail polish; and male influencers and nail polish brands. Each sub section may have similar or bits of the same information from previous sections. The largest sub section as of now, would be male influencers and brands as this will be exploring that recent trend of male celebrities creating their own nail polish brands and how this affects the view and stereotype of men and nail polish. Like other sections the design is still uncertain and will require a mockup to finalize the details.</h3>
